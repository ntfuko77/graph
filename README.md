This module is designed solely for graph-based computation. It provides the core logic for constructing and analyzing graphs, such as vertices, edges, and weighted relationships.
The game.py file is not essential to the moduleâ€”it simply serves as an example or demonstration of how the graph logic can be applied in a game-like context.
